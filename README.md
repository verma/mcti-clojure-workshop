# Goals
## Primary Goals

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/verma/mcti-clojure-workshop](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/verma/mcti-clojure-workshop?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)
- Gain familarity with Clojure(Script).
- Learn about functional programming.
- Learn about the Clojure(Script) ecosystem (bootstrapping apps).
- REPL based development.
- Develop a simple program or a web-app.
- Go home with 20% of what we went through and may be gain insights into better problem solving.

## Secondary Goals
- Learn how to edit LISP (s-expersions using ParEdit).
- Learn how to write web-apps using Reagent (react.js with a ClojureScript wrapper around it).

# Pre-reqs
- A computer with [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) installed on it.
- Some programming experience (e.g. knowledge of concepts like variables, conditionals, loops, functions).
- Some Experience with using the Terminal.
- [LightTable](http://lighttable.com/) installed.  This can be used for experimentation or as a full on development environment.
- ___Optional but highly recommended___ : [Cursive](https://cursiveclojure.com/), you would need to install [IntelliJIDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) to get this to work.
- If you're not too excited about Cursive or LightTable, you may bring your favorite text-editor, but you're on your own with diagnosing any issues that may come up. VIM users: [vim-fireplace](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fireplace), Emacs users: [cider](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider).

# Day Breakup

- `0:00 - 0:30` - Introductions and motivation for being at the Workshop.
- `0:30 - 1:00` - Hands-on whirlwind tour of Clojure Syntax using LightTable and [David Nolen's LightTable + ClojureScript Tutorial](https://github.com/swannodette/lt-cljs-tutorial).
- `1:00 - 1:30` - Ecosystem pains, learn about [lein](http://leiningen.org/).  Setup a project.
- `1:30 - 2:00` - Learn about editing LISP (aka deal with Parenthesis).  Not like lines of text but like a tree (s-exprs, barf, slurp, splice etc.).
- `2:00 - 3:00` - Try out how Clojure (Functional languages) does things differently (Immutability, Atoms, Identities etc.).
- `3:00 - End`  - Do fun coding while colaborating with peers with mini-sessions into Reagent for web-app development.
- `End - End + 1:00` - Demos.
